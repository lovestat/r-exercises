```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

set.seed(962019)
x <- sample(1:100, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
```

select every third values from x beginning at position 2;
```{r}
x[seq(from = 2, to = length(x), by = 3)]

```

remove all values with an odd index;
```{r}
x[-seq(from = 1, to = length(x), by = 2)]
```


remove every 4th value, but only if it is odd;
```{r}
x[seq_along(x) %% 4 != 0 | x %% 2 == 1]

```


remove all numbers divisible by 3 or 7 and replace them with 0.

```{r}
x[x %% 3 == 0 | x %% 7 == 0] <- 0
x
```
