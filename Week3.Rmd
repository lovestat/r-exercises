Exercises
Use the built-in data frame longley to answer the following questions.

1. What year was the percentage of people employed relative to the population highest? Return the result as a data frame.

```{r}
longley %>% 
  datatable()

longley %>% 
  mutate(Emploey.rate = Employed/Population) %>% 
  arrange(desc(Emploey.rate)) %>% 
  datatable()
```


2. The Korean war took place from 1950 - 1953. Filter the data frame so it only contains data from those years.
```{r}
longley %>% 
  filter(Year %in% 1950:1953) %>% 
  datatable()
```


3. What years did the number of people in the armed forces exceed the number of people unemployed?
```{r}
longley %>% 
  filter(Armed.Forces > Unemployed) %>% 
  datatable()
```
